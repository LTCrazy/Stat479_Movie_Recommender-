# Stat479_Movie_Recommender-

Abstract:

This is a machine learning project for movie recommendation system with limited user information. To protect users' privacy and allow third-party organization to predict one's movie taste at the same time, we constructed machine learning models with only the information of the movies that have been watched by each individual and their ratings. The classifiers we used include KNN, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and clustering. We have reached the accuracy of correctly recommending a movie that a user would of 90% like with KNN and approximately 70% with random forest and logistic regression. More variables would be considered in the future such as text review with bayes net approach.
